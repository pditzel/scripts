# borgbackup-script

As I switched from Mac back to Linux I had the need for a cool backupsolution. So I found borgbackup.
While borgbackup is for commandline use I have to write a script around borgbackup to automate the backup of my Linux.
Here is what I came up with.

## WARNING

This is just an idea. It is not testet yes (2018-06-05). 
But feel free to test and/or improve this script.
