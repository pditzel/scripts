# Scripts

Here are some of my scripts I use for daily work or to have some fun with my computers and network.


## adblock-bind

Use the bind DNS for adblocking.

## fritzbox-capture

Using the caturing capability of the fritzbox (yes it works just with a website) to monitor the fritzbox-traffic on a linux host.

## hdwipe

Had a bunch of harddisks to wipe all data from them. So I wrote a very short script for wiping the harddrives and showing a statusbar (cli).
## htpasswd-autmated

Some times it happens that you get just a userlist and you have to create passwords and a htpasswd-file. If the userlist is short aou do not have any problem. But if not... 
Here is an idea for the automation.
